* The theme is having a course of action to follow.
* People of this style focus on knowing what to do and keep themselves, the group, or the project on track.
* They prefer to enter a situation having an idea of what is to happen.
* They identify a process to accomplish a goal and have a somewhat contained tension as they work to create and monitor a plan.
* The aim is not the plan itself, but to use it as a guide to move things along toward the goal.
* Their informed and deliberate decisions are based on analyzing, outlining, conceptualizing or foreseeing what needs to be done.
