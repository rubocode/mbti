| Work best when they can plan their work and follow the plan | Do not mind leaving things open for last-minute changes |
| Like to get things settled and finished | Adapt well to changing situations |
| May decide things too quickly | May have trouble making decisions, feeling like they never have enough information |
| May dislike to interrupt the project they are on for a more urgent one | May start too many projects and have difficulty in finishing them |
| Tend to be satisfied once they reach a judgment on a thing, situation or person | May postpone unpleasant jobs |
| Want only the essentials needed to begin work | Want to know all about a new job |
| Schedule projects so that each step gets done on time | Get a lot accomplished at the last minute under pressure of a deadline |
| Use lists as agendas for action | Use lists as reminders of all the things they have to do someday |
