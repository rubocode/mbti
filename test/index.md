## Personality Type Test

> Always remember that you are absolutely unique.  Just like everyone else.  
> **Margaret Mead**

This [Peronality Type Test](https://www.idrlabs.com/test.php) prepared by
Individual Differences Research Labs ([www.idrlabs.com](https://www.idrlabs.com)) contains 44 questions,
each with a choice from two alternatives.
The test takes, on the average, about 15 to 20 minutes to complete.

Answer the questions honestly, not as you would have liked  yourself to be but as you really are at the moment.
As the result, you will receive a four letter code like INTP, ENFJ or some other combination of E, I, S, N, T, F, J and P.
That is your personality type code.
