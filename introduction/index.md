## Introduction

There are many different ways of classifying human personality into larger
categories to help us understand the differences between individuals.
One of them is the _Myers-Briggs Type Indicator_ which is derived from the
work of _Carl Gustav Jung_.  It takes an analytical approach.

Jung’s key insight was that the human personality depended heavily on how
the brain acquired information (mode of perception) and how it made decisions
(approach to judgment).
Perception is one of two modes — _Sensing_ or _Intuition_.
Judgment is one of two kinds — _Thinking_ and _Feeling_.
He found that a given individual has a preference for one of the modes of
perception and one of the kinds of judgment — in the same manner as that
individual may be right-handed or left-handed.
He also realized that people are either _Extraverted_ or _Introverted_.
The extraverted individual gains energy by being with other people
while the introverted individual gains energy in solitude.

_Isabel Briggs-Myers_ who later developed the inventory to test individuals
to identify these preferences — the _Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)_ —
also realized that each individual also has a preference between
_Perception_ (observation) and _Judgment_ (decision) as the primary mode
of operation.

This resulted in four categories in the classification of personality type.

| Perception | Judgment | Nature | Orientation |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|  _Intuition_ (N) | _Thinking_ (T) | _Extraverted_ (E) | _Judgment_ (J)|
| _Sensing_ (S) | _Feeling_ (F) | _Introverted_ (I) | _Perception_ (P) | 

Given that an individual has a preference in each of the four categories,
we get sixteen distinct styles of operation of the brain.
It is significant that these preferences don’t change over the lifetime of
an individual — suggesting different biological architectures
(configurations or types of CPU) of the brain.
Brain power is also determined by an individual’s capacity — also genetically
determined — similar to the speed of the CPU combined with memory (RAM) capacity.

When we learn over time, we collect, analyze, classify and store information
in a way similar to filing data away on a hard disk of a computer.
We use the CPU and RAM to acquire, process, store and retrieve information.
Our classification processes provide the necessary integration of the knowledge.
