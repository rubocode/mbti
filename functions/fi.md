* Fi users tend to use emotion-laden vocabulary (i.e. Preferring the phrase, “I feel like...” over “I think that...”).
* Fi dominant types tend to ‘zone out’ or daydream more than any other type – they may even do this in the middle of a conversation.
* They are incredibly patient listeners who are happy to let you talk for as long as you need to, without jumping in to offer solutions.
* These types connect and show empathy by exposing their own experiences and struggles as a means of letting you know you’re not alone.
* Fi users are the easiest types to offend, particularly if you question an aspect of their identity or betray one of their morals.
* They will almost always argue from a subjective or emotional standpoint – often using the way they feel as an argument in and of itself.
* These types make other people feel comfortable by exhibiting an inclusive, non-judgmental attitude toward them.
* These types usually advocate for staying true to oneself, following your heart and doing what you know to be right.
