* Introverted thinkers like talking about facts or theories and information – when conversation turns to people or events, you can almost see their eyes glazing over.
* Dominant introverted thinkers require a great deal of alone time. They aren’t shy about overtly ignoring others if they infringe on this.
* Dominant Ti users often have a grumpy or aloof demeanor but a good sense of humor beneath it.
* In conversation, they may ask slightly different versions of the same question multiple times, as they try to figure out precisely how it fits in with what they already know.
* They may zone out of conversations as they relate what you’re saying to their current understanding of the topic – and then zone back in to ask clarifiers.
* Dominant introverted thinkers may have trouble explaining something in a direct way – they tend to branch off and get lost explaining different components of how a given system works.
* Ti dominants are indifferent to most small-scale decisions and will avoid making them whenever possible.
* These types usually advocate for looking at things objectively, questioning everything and ensuring you understand a given situation fully before making a decision about it.
