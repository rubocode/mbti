* Se dominant types are highly in tune with their environments and are constantly scanning their surroundings.
* They may be more physically ‘wired’ than other types and have trouble sitting still.
* Se users tend to be ‘up for anything’ and don’t mind changing or hopping on board with plans at the last minute.
* They tend to make very direct observations about people and situations – they don’t beat around the bush and are the masters of saying what everyone else was secretly thinking.
* They enjoy slapstick or ‘obvious’ humor.
* They enjoy the ‘finer things in life’ and may be particularly attracted to expensive gadgets or high fashion.
* Dominant Se users are almost always present and engaged in conversation, unless something in the immediate environment is distracting them.
* These types usually advocate for ‘Just going for it’ – that is, following your gut instinct and approaching what you want directly.
