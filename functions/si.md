* Si users have excellent memories when it comes to specific facts and occurrences and will usually remember things you’ve mentioned only in passing.
* They are incredibly detail-oriented and usually ask for specific clarifications in conversation (i.e. “Where did you meet up? What day?”)
* They are uncomfortable with the ambiguous and in conversation, they prefer relaying relevant facts to speculating, i.e. when discussing possibilities for the future, they will point out what has happened in a similar situation in the past.
* They enjoy having things planned out in a predictable fashion.
* Si users tend to place a higher value on tradition, social conventions and status than other types.
* These types usually advocate for using the tried and true method, referencing the facts that already exist on the matter and assuming that the future will resemble the past.
