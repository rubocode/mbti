* Everything an Ni dominant type does is deliberate. You will likely get the sense that they have carefully (but covertly) planned out their actions and words.
* They may ask many questions in conversation, but questions tend to be open-ended, i.e. “Can you tell me more about that,” As opposed to, “When did that happen?”
* They prefer sticking to one topic of conversation but may feel the need to ‘explain around’ the topic if they are unable to convey the essence of it concisely.
* Ni dominant types usually pause to fully take in and consider what you have said in conversation before replying.
* They may also return to a topic of conversation weeks after you’ve had it, having processed and analyzed what you’ve said more fully.
* They enjoy talking about future possibilities in a linear fashion.
* These types have a lot of ‘epiphanies’ or ‘realizations.’ Ni dominant types often give off a stoic or “Zen” vibe.
* These types usually advocate for thinking through your options carefully, optimizing your experiences and keeping your long-term objectives in mind at all times.
