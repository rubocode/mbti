* Theme is composing, using whatever is at hand to get a harmonious, aesthetic result.
* Talents lie in combining, varying, and improvising, frequently in the arts but also in business and elsewhere.
* With their senses keenly tuned in, they become totally absorbed in the action of the moment, finding just what fits the situation or the composition.
* Thrive on having the freedom to vary what they do until they get just the right effect.
* Take action to help others and demonstrate values.
* Kind and sensitive to the suffering of others.
